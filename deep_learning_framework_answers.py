# What is TensorFlow 2.0, and how is it different from TensorFlow 1.x
TensorFlow 2.0 is a major upgrade of TensorFlow that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Unlike TensorFlow 1.x, TF 2.0 integrates Keras as the default high-level API, supports eager execution by default, and provides better debugging, model deployment, and modular design.

# How do you install TensorFlow 2.0
Use the following command: `pip install tensorflow` to install TensorFlow 2.0. You can specify a version using `pip install tensorflow==2.x`.

# What is the primary function of the tf.function in TensorFlow 2.0
`tf.function` is used to convert a Python function into a high-performance TensorFlow graph, enabling better performance by avoiding Python overhead during training or inference.

# What is the purpose of the Model class in TensorFlow 2.0
The `Model` class (from `tf.keras.Model`) provides the structure for defining, training, evaluating, and saving deep learning models in an object-oriented way.

# How do you create a neural network using TensorFlow 2.0
You use `tf.keras.Sequential` or subclass `tf.keras.Model`, then add layers like `Dense`, compile the model, and call `.fit()` to train.

# What is the importance of Tensor Space in TensorFlow
Tensor space refers to the multidimensional array structure (tensors) that TensorFlow uses to represent and manipulate data. It is foundational to all computations in the framework.

# How can TensorBoard be integrated with TensorFlow 2.0
TensorBoard can be used by logging data with `tf.summary` during training and launching with `tensorboard --logdir=logs/`.

# What is the purpose of TensorFlow Playground
TensorFlow Playground is an interactive web app that visualizes how neural networks learn, using simple datasets and various hyperparameter controls.

# What is Netron, and how is it useful for deep learning models
Netron is a viewer for neural network, deep learning, and machine learning models. It helps visualize model architecture and inspect layers and weights.

# What is the difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (with some dynamic support), while PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, making it more Pythonic and intuitive for debugging. PyTorch is generally preferred in academia; TensorFlow is widely used in industry.

# How do you install PyTorch
Install with pip: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio` or visit [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) for a command specific to your OS/compute setup.

# What is the basic structure of a PyTorch neural network
It consists of a class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, a constructor defining layers, and a `forward` method for forward pass logic.

# What is the significance of tensors in PyTorch
Tensors are the core data structure in PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU acceleration and auto-differentiation support.

# What is the difference between torch.Tensor and torch.cuda.Tensor in PyTorch
`torch.Tensor` resides on CPU by default, while `torch.cuda.Tensor` is on GPU, offering faster computations for large models.

# What is the purpose of the torch.optim module in PyTorch
It provides optimization algorithms (like SGD, Adam) to update model parameters based on gradients during training.

# What are some common activation functions used in neural networks
ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, Leaky ReLU, and ELU are commonly used to introduce non-linearity.

# What is the difference between torch.nn.Module and torch.nn.Sequential in PyTorch
`torch.nn.Module` allows flexible model definition; `Sequential` is a container for layers executed in order, suitable for simple models.

# How can you monitor training progress in TensorFlow 2.0
Using callbacks like `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`, `ModelCheckpoint`, or plotting metrics with Matplotlib during or after training.

# How does the Keras API fit into TensorFlow 2.0
Keras is tightly integrated as `tf.keras`, providing a user-friendly API for model development, training, and deployment.

# What is an example of a deep learning project that can be implemented using TensorFlow 2.0
Image classification using CNNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset, or sentiment analysis using RNNs on movie reviews dataset.

# What is the main advantage of using pre-trained models in TensorFlow and PyTorch?
Pre-trained models save time and computational resources and allow transfer learning to improve performance with smaller datasets.

# How do you install and verify that TensorFlow 2.0 was installed successfully
Install with `pip install tensorflow`. Verify with `import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)`.

# How can you define a simple function in TensorFlow 2.0 to perform addition
```python
@tf.function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

# How can you create a simple neural network in TensorFlow 2.0 with one hidden layer
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```

# How can you visualize the training progress using TensorFlow and Matplotlib
Plot accuracy/loss from `history.history` after model training using `plt.plot()` from matplotlib.

# How do you install PyTorch and verify the PyTorch installation
`pip install torch torchvision`; verify with `import torch; print(torch.__version__)`.

# How do you create a simple neural network in PyTorch
```python
class Net(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Net, self).__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
  def forward(self, x):
    return self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
```

# How do you define a loss function and optimizer in PyTorch
`loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`, `optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)`

# How do you implement a custom loss function in PyTorch
```python
def custom_loss(output, target):
  return torch.mean((output - target)**2)
```

# How do you save and load a TensorFlow model?
Save with `model.save('model.h5')` and load with `tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')`.
